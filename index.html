					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>The other week, a man downtown told me that, as a prophet of God, he prophesized that I would be one too. 
						The next day while getting off a bus, I saw $14 on the floor. But, my hands were full. I could not pick up the money.
						I think a prophet of God would have better luck than that.
						I am very comfortable with my life as a commoner. Prophecy has already failed me once.
